(Tools for) Value-Driven Design
===============================

Tools intended to help with modelling decisions in a value centric
design process. The intent is to keep this as generic as possible, as
some of this decision modelling is suited to generic decision-making,
non-design activities with a little massaging.


Roadmap
-------

  - Model sets for comparative work (rather than a single set of
	characteristic parameter values). 
  - Improved visualisation.
  - Interactive model building via the CLI.
  - Export CODA models to Excel template.
  - Binary matrix requirement weighting.
  - House of Quality style requirement/characteristic weighting.
